        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken thighs</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Spices and seasonings</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Pat chicken thighs dry with a paper towel and brush skins with olive oil. Place chicken thighs, skin-side down, in a single layer on a plate.</li>
            <li>Combine smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Sprinkle 1/2 of the seasoning mixture evenly over thighs. Turn thighs over and evenly sprinkle with remaining seasoning. Arrange thighs, skin-side up, in a single layer in the air fryer basket.</li>
            <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer until thighs are brown and the juices run clear, about 18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
